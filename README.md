# AES

AES, or advanced entity system, is an archetype-based entity component system that supports most modern
ECS patterns. Despite being made in a short period of time, AES aims to handle real-world game development scenarios 
without requiring modification to standard ECS usage patterns. AES itself is developed as a learning resource for C++ 
game developers who have interests in high-performance systems design.

AES source code tries to be self-documenting as much as possible while being fast and memory-efficient without 
getting too complicated. The documentation emphasizes design and engineering principles before implementation details. 
Each commit in the repository is intentionally incremental, focusing on one aspect of the system at a time to 
gradually make the development process more accessible to those learning ECS architecture.
